Name: FullstackEm Portfolio
Description: This is the repository that will hold future projects as I progress through the Professional Certificate in Coding: Fulls Stack Development with MERN program with MIT.
Roadmap: As this repository has more projects added over the next 10 months, you will be able to see that I have learned many new skills in MongoDB, Express, React, and Node.js.
